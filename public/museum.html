      <p>
        During the late 1960s, after graduating from UC Davis (BA, 1966; MA,
        1967) and moving to New York, Stephen Kaltenbach established a
        reputation in the emerging international field of Conceptual art. But in
        1970, just as he was achieving career success, Kaltenbach abruptly
        withdrew to California’s Central Valley, appearing to abandon Conceptual
        work in favor of the more traditional mediums of painting and sculpture.
        Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of his “dropout,” this exhibition
        considers Kaltenbach’s engagement with time as a principal theme across
        his remarkably diverse career, which encompasses bronze time capsules,
        advertisements placed anonymously in Artforum magazine in 1968-69, and
        the monumental photorealist painting Portrait of My Father (1972-79)
